# Contributing to Terraform Repository

Thank you for contributing to this repository! To ensure high-quality changes and maintain stability, we enforce a **Pull Request (PR) workflow** where all changes must be reviewed and approved before merging into the `main` branch.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Branching Strategy**
- The **`main` branch is protected** and **direct commits are not allowed**.
- Contributors should **create branches** from `main` and submit a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.
- Use the following branch naming conventions:
  - **Feature Branches**: `feature/<short-description>`
  - **Bug Fixes**: `fix/<short-description>`
  - **Hotfixes** (urgent fixes in `main`): `hotfix/<short-description>`
  - **Documentation Updates**: `docs/<short-description>`
